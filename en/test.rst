In the process of application development, testing  is very important. Testing requires is checking by repeating, and it is a boring process. So, if you can automate it, do it.

Unit Test of the Model

In this session, we try to check if the model works the right way.  The test framework follows TestLib attached by Qt; please see its `documentation <http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qttestlib/qtest-overview.html>`_ .

Letâ€™s test the Blog model code that we made in the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`. Make a common library for the model in advance. At first, we will create a working directory in the test directory.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ cd test
  $ mkdir blog
  $ cd blog

We try to create the test case for creating and reading of the Blog model.
We make the name of implementing test, TestBlog. Source code with the following content is saved as the file name *testlog.cpp* .

.. code-block:: c++
  
  #include <TfTest/TfTest>
  #include "models/blog.h"    //  include the model class

  class TestBlog : public QObject
  {
      Q_OBJECT
  private slots:
      void create_data();
      void create();
  };

  void TestBlog::create_data()
  {
      // definition of test data
      QTest::addColumn<QString>("title"); 
      QTest::addColumn<QString>("body");
      
      // adding to test data
      QTest::newRow("No1") << "Hello" << "Hello world.";
  }

  void TestBlog::create()
  {
      // acquisition of test data
      QFETCH(QString, title); 
      QFETCH(QString, body);
       
      // logic of the test
      Blog created = Blog::create(title, body);
      int id = created.id();
      Blog blog = Blog::get(id);  // Getting model ID
       
      // verification of result execution 
      QCOMPARE(blog.title(), title); 
      QCOMPARE(blog.body(), body);
  }

  TF_TEST_MAIN(TestBlog)   // specify the class name you created
  #include "testblog.moc"  // charm. Make the extension .moc

As supplemental comment, among this, create() method can do the test, and QCOMPARE macro can check the real returning value. The create_data() method works as passing test data to the create_data() method. 
The rule is always to put  '_data' at the end of the method name.

In this example, I am doing the following in  create_data () method.

  + QTest::addColumn() function : Define the name and type of test data.
  + QTest::newRow() function :  Add test data.

The following is done in the create () method.

  + Fetch the test data.
  + Run the test logic.
  + Verify that the result is correct.

Next, create a project file to make the *Makefile*. The file name is testblog.pro, saving the contents as the following.

.. code-block:: ini
  
  TARGET = testblog
  TEMPLATE = app
  CONFIG += console debug qtestlib
  CONFIG -= app_bundle
  QT += network sql
  QT -= gui
  DEFINES += TF_DLL
  INCLUDEPATH += ../..
  LIBS += -L../../lib -lmodel
  include(../../appbase.pri)
  SOURCES = testblog.cpp      # Specifying the file name

Part of the specification has changed after the update to Qt5. If you are using Qt5, please change the 5th line of the above as the following.

.. code-block:: ini
  
  QT += network sql testlib

After you save the project file, you can create a binary by running the following command in its directory

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ qmake
  $ make

Next, configuration needs to be done for the testing process. 
Because of the need to refer to the various configuration files, the test command requires a symbolic link to the config directory. Its location should be directly below that of the test command. When SQLite is used for the database, we need to make a symbolic link to *db* directory as well.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ ln -s  ../../config  config
  $ ln -s  ../../db  db

If you use Windows, an exe file of the test is created in the debug directory, so that a symbolic link is made there.  Please be careful; it is NOT a shortcut.  
To make a symbolic link, you must run the command from the command prompt launched with administrator privileges.

.. code-block:: bat
  
  > cd debug 
  > mklink /D  config  ..\..\..\config
  > mklink /D  db  ..\..\..\db

Furthermore, take the path to the common library including the Blog model. 
In the case of Linux, set the environment variable as follows.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ export  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/blogapp/lib

If you use Windows, add the setting to PATH variables.

.. code-block:: bat
  
  > set PATH=C:\path\to\blogapp\lib;%PATH%

Then check the connection information for the database. In the unit test, the connection information in the test section in the database configuration file (*database.ini*) is used.

.. code-block:: ini
  
  [test]
  DriverType=QMYSQL
  DatabaseName=blogdb
  HostName=
  Port=
  UserName=root
  Password=
  ConnectOptions=

The configuration is now complete. Next, the test is implemented. If you can test successfully, you can see the following message on the screen. 
In the case of Windows, please implement on the TreeFrog Command Prompt.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ ./testblog
  ********* Start testing of TestBlog *********
  Config: Using QTest library 4.8.3, Qt 4.8.3
  PASS   : TestBlog::initTestCase()
  PASS   : TestBlog::create()
  PASS   : TestBlog::cleanupTestCase()
  Totals: 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
  ********* Finished testing of TestBlog *********

If, however, the result is not what was expected, you will see the following message.

::
  
  ********* Start testing of TestBlog *********
  Config: Using QTest library 4.8.3, Qt 4.8.3
  PASS   : TestBlog::initTestCase()
  FAIL!  : TestBlog::create(No1) Compared values are not the same
     Actual (blog.body()): foo bar.
     Expected (body): Hello world.
     Loc: [testblog.cpp(33)]
  PASS   : TestBlog::cleanupTestCase()

  ********* Finished testing of TestBlog *********

Make a test case in the each model. Then please do the test. They key to good Web application development is to be sure that the model is working properly.
