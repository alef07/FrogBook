Requirements
=============


Operating environment
---------------------

 + Windows XP/Vista/7/8, Linux, UNIX-like OS or Mac OS X
 + Qt version 4.6 or later, 5.0 or later â€“ Qt Project
 

Development environment
-----------------------

In order to develop a Web application in TreeFrog Framework, you must have C++ development tools appropriate to the operating environment as above. For the time being, development is possible using the g++ compiler to make and edit commands.

MinGW is available for Windows. Qt Creator IDE is also a good idea. I'm currently awaiting further information, but it should be possible to develop using any Visual Studio and Eclipse, (although I not yet tried it).

On Mac OS X, if you install Xcode, various commands such as a compiler are installed. For Linux, I recommend installing the packages that are provided with the distribution.

For debugging, Qt Creator is the safe choice because it is a framework that is based on Qt.
